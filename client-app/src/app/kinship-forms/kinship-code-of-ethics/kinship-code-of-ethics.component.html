      <h3>CODE OF ETHICS</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Therefore, Saint Francis Community Services Kinship Providers voluntarily subscribe to and uphold the following code of ethics:
    </p>
    <p>Kinship Care is based on the theory that no unit in society other than the family has ever been able to provide the special
      qualities needed to nurture children to their fullest physical, mental, emotional and spiritual development. If for
      a certain period of time a birth family is unable to provide these special qualities, substitute care must be provided.
      Kinship providers must be committed to the dignity and worth of children and their families. They must recognize and
      respect the rights of birth parents. They must have faith in the family system. They must be willing to cooperate with
      the child-placing agency, St. Francis Community Services, in developing and implementing a plan of care for the child
      in placement.</p>
    <p>Kinship Care is a public trust that requires providers and practitioners be dedicated to service for the best interest
      of children and families; that they are knowledgeable about family systems, interactions between people and community
      resources; and that they promote competence, accountability, responsibility and excellence in providing caring without
      discrimination. They will strive to assure that each child in their care grows to understand that they are capable,
      lovable, worthwhile and responsible.</p>
    <p>Each Kinship Provider has an obligation to constantly examine, maintain and improve their practice of caring for children.
      They acknowledge the need to improve and develop their skills in providing the highest possible quality of care for
      children and families.</p>
    <p>1. My responsibility is for the best interest of the child and family being served.</p>
    <p>2. I hold myself responsible for the quality of the services I provide.</p>
    <p>3. I will work cooperatively with St. Francis Community Services in maintaining the plan of care for the child in placement.</p>
    <p>4. I accept the right of children in care to have access to services and family-centered care.</p>
    <p>5. I accept the child and families right to confidentiality and will keep information pertaining to the child and family
      confidential from others in the community.</p>
    <p>6. I shall respect the work of all individuals, regardless of race, religion, sex, national ancestry or cultural diversity
      in my capacity as a Kinship Provider.</p>
    <p>7. I accept the need to continually develop my skills as a Kinship Provider and will take advantage of educational opportunities
      to improve my skills.</p>
    <p>8. I accept that those whom I serve will also be my teachers and will strive to put what I learn from them into practice
      as a Kinship Provider.</p>
    <p>9. My relationship with community resources such as mental and physical health providers, educational systems, the courts
      and other organizations/agencies on behalf of the child will be conducted with honesty, fairness and respect.</p>
    <p>10. I will promote and encourage ethical standards of practice by all individuals and organizations providing care for
      children and families.</p>
    <p>11. I shall respect the views and actions of fellow Kinship Providers and use appropriate channels to express my opinions.</p>
    <p>12. I shall distinguish clearly in public between my opinions and actions as an individual and as a representative of
      St. Francis Community Services Kinship Program.</p>
    <p>13. I accept responsibility for working toward the creation and maintenance of conditions within the field of foster
      care/kinship care, which uphold and promote this code of ethics.</p>
